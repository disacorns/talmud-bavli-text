# talmud-bavli-text

Talmud Bavli from Machon Mamre, converted from original htm files to txt files.

I needed a copy of the talmud bavli that I could work with. So here it is.

l002.zip - Original zip from mechon mamre. Can be found online at: https://www.mechon-mamre.org/htmlzips/l002.zip

htm - Extracted contents from original mechon mamre zip.

txt - Simple conversion to txt files. Added colons in the initial, originally bold, headings "גמרא:" and "משנה:" for clarity. RTL appears wonky here, but the text should be good. Renamed dappim based on their gematrias, for easier sorting. There is not supposed to be a page "1". Moved out the seperate perek entries to txt_by_perek.

txt_by_perek - Moved into here the redundant sections that were broken up by perakim. Not necessary.
