# talmud-bavli-text

Talmud Bavli from Mechon Mamre, converted from original htm files to txt files.
Tremendous gratitude to all those who worked on the Mechon Mamre version. 

I needed a copy of the talmud bavli that I could work with. So here it is.

l002.zip - Original zip from mechon mamre. Can be found online at: https://www.mechon-mamre.org/htmlzips/l002.zip

htm - Extracted contents from original mechon mamre zip.

txts - Simple conversion to txt files. Added colons in the initial, originally bold, headings "גמרא:" and "משנה:" for clarity. RTL appears wonky here, but the text should be good. Renamed dappim based on their gematrias, for easier sorting. There is not supposed to be a page "1". Moved out the seperate perek entries to txt_by_perek.

txt_by_perek - Moved into here the redundant sections that were broken up by perakim. Not necessary.

clean_txts - Clean is relative. The attempt is to make it closer to the standard texts. Changed "גמרא" to "גמ'" and "משמנה" to "מתני'". Removed verse references. "{}" seem to imply non standard additions, and were removed along with everything in between. "<>" in the Mechon Mamre version seem be the equivilant of "()" in the standard text and were replaced. Sometimes they mean to remove words from the standard as "{}" were meant to add. Without checking each one, these were left as "()". The accuracy of this work hinges entirely on the accuracy and consistancy of the Mechon Mamre version.
